Easy couple looking for a comfortable central flat/apartment in Berlin since November 2013

Hi,

We're a couple looking to get away to Berlin, since November 2013 and at least for 3 months (better if longer).

We know the city already, this will be our fourth winter in this awesome city.

We're looking to rent a comfortable flat/apartment for both of us. Our favourite neigborhoods are: Kreuzberg, Neuk√∂lln and Mitte.

We need an apartment with prefereble two independent separate rooms.

We used to work with the computer so it is very important Internet access on the flat.

We need a fully-furnished apartment, with cooking utensils, bedclothes and so on.

We are a 37 years old couple, normal worker people, easy, noiseless, clean and respectful.

Cecilia is a theater teacher and she use to devour culture and art, and I, Fernando, am a developer building now a new start-up in Berlin.

You can know us a little bit maybe looking on our websites:

Please contact us, note on your mail the approximate **address**, **pictures of the flat** so we could make us an idea of it and, of course, the **total monthly rent** (including heating, electricity and internet).

Also don't hesitate to ask us whatever you need to know. Tell us also the price for the flat and every conditions you think are important.

Regards

fernando and cecilia
